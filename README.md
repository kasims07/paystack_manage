## Usage

To use this package :

```yaml
dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    paystack_manager:
```
Then initialize the package whenever you need it:

```dart

    PaystackPayManager(context: context)
        ..setSecretKey("sk_test_7e3a3dbff5d7b8b2ee7e61125b503ecbba8c850f")
        //accepts widget
        ..setCompanyAssetImage(
          Image(
            image: AssetImage("assets/images/logo.png"),
          )
        )
        ..setAmount(152)
        ..setCurrency("GHS")
        ..setEmail("bakoambrose@gmail.com")
        ..setFirstName("Ambrose")
        ..setLastName("Bako")
        ..setMetadata(
          {
            "custom_fields": [
              {
                "value": "snapTask",
                "display_name": "Payment to",
                "variable_name": "payment_to"
              }
            ]
          },
        )
        ..onSuccesful(_onPaymentSuccessful)
        ..onFailed(_onPaymentFailed)
        ..onCancel(_onPaymentCancelled)
        ..initialize();

```

No other configuration requiredâ€”the plugin works out of the box.
